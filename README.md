# Sarsa-Qlearning-FrozenLake

In this exercise I solve the frozen lake problem with model-free RL algorithms.
The two algorithems that are implemented are sarsa and Q-learning.
Given is the following MDP:  γ = 0.9, reward r(s, a, s0) = −0.04 except for the terminal states, where it is
+1 and -1, respectively.
